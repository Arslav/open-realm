# Android bring-up

## Scope

The first target is Warcraft III on an arm64 Android tablet using SDL2 and GLES3.
`make android-probe` builds a standalone production-shader diagnostic.
`make android-warcraft3` builds the full Warcraft III runtime and a platform MPQ importer.
Retail game data is supplied by the user and is never included in either APK.

Game APKs include a pinned FFmpeg decoder for campaign movies. Import files from the original
`Movies/` directory as well as the main archives; AVI movies retain their historical `.mpq` suffix
and are installed separately under `files/data/Movies/`. See [movie playback](games/warcraft-3/pre-rendered-movies.md)
for first-launch intros, campaign preludes, source-build options and automated checks.
See [iPad packaging](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/blob/main/packaging/ipad/README.md) for the existing mobile module/source split and
[renderer platforms](build-and-renderer-platforms.md) for the GLES3 contract.

Keep SDK downloads, AVD images, logs, and screenshots under ignored `build/android/`.
Run commands from the repository root. Use a Java runtime supported by the installed SDK tools;
the local macOS setup uses the JBR bundled with PhpStorm:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME='/Applications/PhpStorm.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home'
export ANDROID_HOME="$PWD/build/android/sdk"
export ANDROID_USER_HOME="$PWD/build/android/user"
export ANDROID_AVD_HOME="$PWD/build/android/avd"
```

## SDK and virtual device

Download the Apple Silicon command-line tools from the [official Android SDK page](https://developer.android.com/studio),
verify its published SHA-256, and extract its `cmdline-tools/` directory as
`build/android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/`. The initial setup used build 15859902 (Mac ARM64), SHA-256
`835b62a26162b229b441d1f6d4680383815a270809eb33522c0d480fa5002c4e`.

```sh
"$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager" --sdk_root="$ANDROID_HOME" \
  'emulator' 'platform-tools' 'system-images;android-35;default;arm64-v8a'
mkdir -p "$ANDROID_AVD_HOME"
printf 'no\n' | "$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager" create avd \
  --name openrealm_tablet_api35 --package 'system-images;android-35;default;arm64-v8a' \
  --device medium_tablet --path "$ANDROID_AVD_HOME/openrealm_tablet_api35.avd"
```

Review and accept the SDK license when prompted. SDK tools build 15859902 still provides `sdkmanager`
and `avdmanager`; `sdkmanager` prints a deprecation notice recommending the newer Android CLI.
The selected image is Android 15 / API 35, arm64-v8a, without Google Play or Google APIs.

Before first boot, edit matching keys in `$ANDROID_AVD_HOME/openrealm_tablet_api35.avd/config.ini`
to use the smaller landscape tablet configuration verified here (the stock medium-tablet profile is 2560x1600):

```ini
avd.id=openrealm_tablet_api35
avd.name=OpenRealm Tablet API 35
hw.lcd.width=1280
hw.lcd.height=800
hw.lcd.density=160
hw.initialOrientation=landscape
hw.gpu.enabled=yes
hw.ramSize=2048
hw.keyboard=yes
hw.audioInput=no
hw.sdCard=no
disk.dataPartition.size=4G
```

Remove `sdcard.size` from that configuration. The Android emulator documentation notes that SD card
images are unsupported on Apple Silicon; app data remains on the virtual data partition.

Launch in a terminal (closing the emulator window stops the device):

```sh
"$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator" -avd openrealm_tablet_api35 -port 5554 \
  -gpu auto -memory 2048 -cores 4 -no-snapshot -no-boot-anim \
  -camera-back none -camera-front none
```

Check completion of boot and collect graphics diagnostics:

```sh
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell getprop sys.boot_completed
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell getprop ro.build.version.release
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell dumpsys SurfaceFlinger
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 exec-out screencap -p > build/android/emulator.png
```

`sys.boot_completed` must return `1`; an adb transport in `device` state alone does not prove boot completion.
Select the serial explicitly to avoid operating on a connected physical device.
Emulator GPU strings describe its translation stack, not physical Adreno/Mali compatibility or performance.
See [Android emulator commands](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline).

## Verified local environment

The initial Apple Silicon setup booted successfully with emulator 37.2.12 and platform-tools 37.0.1.
`emulator -accel-check` reported Hypervisor.Framework available. Adb serial `emulator-5554` returned
`sys.boot_completed=1`, Android release `15`, ABI `arm64-v8a`, display `1280x800`, and page size `4096`.
SurfaceFlinger reported GLES 3.1 through ANGLE/Vulkan SwiftShader with `-gpu auto`:
CPU virtualization is accelerated, but graphics in this run uses software rendering.
A captured screenshot showed the Android launcher. Logs and capture are local ignored artifacts:
`build/android/emulator.log`, `surfaceflinger.txt`, and `emulator.png`.

`avdmanager` printed missing `devices.xml` diagnostics for this default image but returned success,
created the profile, and the emulator subsequently booted. Confirm the generated config and boot status
rather than treating the diagnostic alone as either fatal or proof of success.

## SDL2 / production shader APK

The opt-in `packaging/android/` target uses CMake with the NDK toolchain and the Android SDK's
`javac`/D8/AAPT2/zipalign/apksigner pipeline, without Gradle or Android Studio. It compiles
`renderer/r_shader.c` directly: shader bodies, declarations and the `vendor/gl_shader` compiler are
the production implementations, not copied GLSL. Hidden symbols and section garbage collection
discard unrelated renderer runtime functions; there are no fake engine imports or modified game APIs.

Install the additional build prerequisites:

```sh
"$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager" --sdk_root="$ANDROID_HOME" \
  'platforms;android-35' 'build-tools;35.0.1' 'ndk;28.2.13676358'
curl -fL https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.32.10/SDL2-2.32.10.tar.gz \
  -o build/android/downloads/SDL2-2.32.10.tar.gz
shasum -a 256 build/android/downloads/SDL2-2.32.10.tar.gz
tar -xzf build/android/downloads/SDL2-2.32.10.tar.gz -C build/android
make android-probe
make android-probe-run ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554
```

The SDL source archive used here hashes to
`5f5993c530f084535c65a6879e9b26ad441169b3e25d789d83287040a9ca5165`.
Java/JBR 25 from the environment above worked. The Java compilation prepends the SDK's
`core-lambda-stubs.jar` to `android.jar`: Android's stub `LambdaMetafactory` alone cannot compile
SDL's Java lambdas. The builder uses Python ZIP support because the PhpStorm JBR lacks the `jar` executable.
SDK Build Tools 35 apksigner emits a Java 25 native-access warning; signing and verification succeed.

The APK supports arm64-v8a, minSdk 26 and targetSdk 35. It contains `libSDL2.so`, `libmain.so` and
the Java SDLActivity shim/subclass. No storage permissions, retail game files, or network permissions are needed.
The debug keystore, SDK, and outputs stay under ignored `build/android/`.

`android-probe-run` installs only to the explicitly selected serial, restarts `org.openrealm.probe`,
waits up to 45 seconds for that process's `RESULT PASS`, and saves `probe-logcat.txt` and `probe.png`.
Build-only output is `build/android/probe/openrealm-probe.apk`; use
`python3 tools/android/build_probe.py --help` for SDK, SDL source and output overrides.
The diagnostic stays open with an animated triangle; Android Back exits it.

### Runtime checks and observed result

- Compile/link all seven non-model descriptors, including terrain/default.
- Compile/link eight combinations of the model shader: instancing, shadows and MSAA defines,
  always with fog of war enabled. This tests shader variants, not actual multisample rendering.
- Keep the production 128-matrix bone palette and verify its final entry has a live uniform location.
- Upload the full palette through `gs_apply`; draw a synthetic triangle weighted entirely to bone 127.
- Translate that bone between two known positions and read both framebuffer locations. Expected
  foreground RGB is `(51,184,235)` and background is `(9,14,23)`; the two locations must exchange colors.
- Verify a 24-bit depth buffer and no GL error during pixel checks.

On the Android 15 ARM64 emulator: **15/15 shader programs passed**, both pixel checks passed,
and the final result was **PASS**. GLES reported 4096 vertex uniform vectors / 16384 components,
so this does not establish support on implementations exposing only the GLES3 minimum.
The production renderer and game code were unchanged. The fixture is synthetic, not an MDX asset loader test.
The UI shows the result over the SDL GL surface, outside immersive mode to avoid the Android first-run
fullscreen tutorial obscuring diagnostics.

APK v2/v3 signature verification and ZIP alignment checks passed. `llvm-readelf -lW` showed every
LOAD segment in both native libraries aligned to `0x4000` (16 KB). Runtime testing used a 4 KB-page image;
a 16 KB-page Android device/image and physical Adreno/Mali checks remain pending.

## Full Warcraft III APK and archive import

```sh
make android-warcraft3
make android-warcraft3-run ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554
```

These use the same SDK/JAVA_HOME/SDL prerequisites as the probe. Output:
`build/android/game/openrealm-warcraft3.apk`, package `org.openrealm.wc3`.
The native build tree is shared at `build/android/probe/native` to reuse SDL across APKs.
The builder disables incremental adb installation after an observed stalled transport;
`adb -s emulator-5554 reconnect` recovered that local transport without restarting other devices.

The launcher uses Android's multi-file `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` picker. It accepts the classic base,
language, expansion and patch archive names listed by `ArchiveStore.archiveName`, normalizing their case.
Reign of Chaos requires `war3.mpq`; the TFT button additionally requires `war3x.mpq`.
File presence enables the buttons; successful play still requires the corresponding complete retail resources.
The importer does not convert Reforged CASC data or unpack ZIP installers.

Selected content URIs are read on a worker thread into a temporary file in app-owned `files/data/`.
The importer checks available space when the size is known, copies in bounded chunks, syncs/closes the
output and provider stream, checks the actual size, and validates the staged archive with the production
`SFileOpenArchive` reader through `libmpqcheck.so`. Only then does an atomic rename replace the target.
Bad filenames, truncated/invalid archives, or stream read/close failures preserve the installed archive.
Transactions are per file: a later error in a multi-file batch does not undo earlier successful files.
Native validation establishes a readable archive, not the presence of every resource needed by Warcraft III.
No broad Android storage permission or persistent URI access is requested; game data is copied locally.

The Java launcher installs project-owned APK `assets/share/` into `files/share/` before play.
`GameActivity` runs in a separate `:game` process and passes ordinary `-data`/`-tft` arguments to SDL_main.
The native `common/main.c` Android paths are `files/share` for read-only defaults and `files/user`
for config/saves. Native stdout/stderr are retained in `files/engine.log`:

```sh
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 exec-out run-as org.openrealm.wc3 \
  cat files/engine.log > build/android/game/engine.log
```

CMake mirrors the desktop/iPad unity source partitions in separate `realm_shared`, `realm_sheet`,
`realm_jass`, `realm_renderer`, `realm_game`, `realm_menu` and `warcraft3` libraries.
ELF `-Bsymbolic` preserves module-owned FDF and world state; undefined symbols remain linker errors.
Assertions remain enabled, matching desktop release: CMake's default NDEBUG would remove the JASS loop bound.
`shared/test.c` uses Android's API-26-compatible `clock_gettime` instead of API-29 `timespec_get`.
The Spirit Link local `far` variable was renamed because Android zlib defines `far` as an empty legacy macro.
The renderer explicitly requests depth24 on Android, as on iPad.

### On-device regression checks without retail data

Generate `build/tests/tests.mpq` with the existing `make test-assets` workflow, then:

```sh
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 push build/tests/tests.mpq /data/local/tmp/openrealm-fixture.mpq
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell run-as org.openrealm.wc3 mkdir -p files
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell run-as org.openrealm.wc3 \
  cp /data/local/tmp/openrealm-fixture.mpq files/fixture.mpq
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell am instrument -w org.openrealm.wc3/.ImportTests
```

`ImportTests` checks successful imports, case normalization, unknown size, malformed MPQ, truncation,
path rejection, read failure and provider-close failure, preserving old bytes and cleaning staging files.
It loads every runtime library and installs the fixture into `cache/engine-smoke`, separately from user data.
It then starts the real SDL_main in the separate game process with `+dedicated 1 +test wc3_smoke.*`.
Only this explicit test launch loads `librealm_smoke.so`, containing the existing `t_smoke.c` tests;
normal play contains no registered smoke tests. Native startup mounts the archive, initializes the server
and game through GetGameAPI, and executes 6 assertions in 4 tests.
The fixture deliberately lacks retail resources: missing SLK diagnostics are expected here and do not
establish that the main menu or campaign works. The instrumentation never installs fixture data into `files/data`.

An initial successful test run exposed `pthread_mutex_lock called on a destroyed mutex` in Android's
`hwuiTask` during native `exit()` teardown. `Sys_Exit` now flushes native streams and uses `_Exit` on Android
to terminate the isolated game process without racing Java/HWUI threads through C++ static destructors;
desktop retains `exit`. Normal Com_Quit still performs engine cleanup first.
On API30+, instrumentation also requires a recorded `ApplicationExitInfo.REASON_EXIT_SELF` with status 0,
so merely printing passing assertions before a native crash is not sufficient.

Verified on the API35 ARM64 emulator: all import transaction checks passed, all runtime modules loaded,
native startup passed 5/5 assertions in 3 smoke tests, and the game process exited with reason EXIT_SELF,
status 0. The corrected log ended after the test summary without FORTIFY errors.
APK signature and ZIP checks passed; every LOAD segment of the ten packaged native libraries
(including the opt-in smoke library) has at least 16 KB alignment. Runtime verification still used 4 KB pages.
Evidence is retained locally in `build/android/game/import-tests.txt`, `engine-smoke.log` and `launcher.png`.

### Retail archive verification

The first retail check used the user's local classic 1.26a installation: `war3.mpq` (458500067 bytes),
`War3Patch.mpq` (45620324), `War3x.mpq` (362993137) and `War3xlocal.mpq` (54039425).
There was no separate War3Local.mpq. All four archives opened with the production SFileOpenArchive reader.
`mpqtool ls` could not enumerate the patch archive, so enumeration must not be used as a proxy for
archive validity. A temporary host checker compiled `common/mpq.c` and `vendor/blast/blast.c` unchanged.

For this developer setup, each archive was pushed via adb to a temporary path under `/data/local/tmp/`,
copied with `run-as org.openrealm.wc3` to a staging file in `files/data/`, checked against the host SHA-256,
then renamed to its canonical lowercase name. Temporary adb copies were removed. No original archive
was changed and no MPQ was added to the APK or repository. This verifies developer installation,
not an end-to-end run through the system document picker.

Both editions reached their real main menus on the API35 ARM64 emulator at 1280x800:

- ROC: logo, Russian button text, 3D battlefield, rain, clouds and water were visible. The log also
  recorded navigation to the single-player screen and the five campaign entries. A subsequent fresh ROC
  process also showed the missing-label symptom below; this is not established as TFT-specific.
- TFT: expansion logo, tower, ice, water and particles were visible. Several button labels were blank
  (Battle.net, Options, Credits, Exit), while Single Player and LAN labels were visible. The localized
  MainMenu FDF references KEY_BATTLE_NET/KEY_OPTIONS/KEY_CREDITS/KEY_QUIT, and those values exist in
  War3xlocal's GlobalStrings.fdf. The missing-label cause remains unconfirmed; do not hardcode replacement labels.
- Both bounded 300-frame checks exited with Android EXIT_SELF/status 0. The menu models emitted a
  missing-valid-Birth-duration warning and used the stable pose; neither run logged a shader failure.

Evidence: `build/android/game/roc-menu.png`, `roc-menu.log`, `roc-open.png`, `tft-menu.png`, `tft-menu.log` and
`retail-exits.txt`. The observed screenshot counters were roughly 9–14 FPS with SwiftShader software
graphics; these are not physical Android GPU performance measurements.

Reproduce a bounded launch from a stopped app:

```sh
"$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb" -s emulator-5554 shell am start -W \
  -n org.openrealm.wc3/.LauncherActivity --ez play true --ei frames 300
# For TFT, additionally pass --ez tft true. frames=0 leaves the app open.
```

The launcher consumes the diagnostic `frames` extra for a single launch. Subsequent Play
button launches are unlimited. Previously the extra remained on the launcher's Intent,
causing every subsequent game to exit normally after the same frame count; on Honor this
appeared as repeated returns to the edition picker (`EXIT_SELF`, status 0).

### Physical Honor verification

The developer APK was installed on an Honor AGM3-AL09HN running Android 12 (API31),
ARM64, with 4 KB pages. Its Mali-G52 MC2 reports OpenGL ES 3.2. All four retail archives
were streamed directly into app-private staging files with `adb shell -T run-as ... dd`,
verified against host SHA-256 checksums, then renamed to canonical lowercase names.
This avoids keeping a second archive copy on a device with limited free space.
On this device `adb exec-in run-as ... dd` produced an empty file; verify streaming with
a small fixture and check every archive checksum before committing the staging file.

The real ROC menu and single-player screen rendered successfully without a shader failure.
User navigation also loaded `Maps/Campaign/Prologue01.w3m`; the opening scene rendered
Thrall, terrain, rain and effects. Screenshot counters showed about 52 FPS in the menu
and 13 FPS in the opening scene; these are individual observations, not benchmarks.
Mission completion, audio and touch command behavior were not verified.

Local evidence: `build/android/honor/archive-checksums.txt`, `roc-menu.log`, `roc-menu.png`,
`current.log` and `current.png`. This establishes initial production rendering on one Mali
device; the standalone bone-127 pixel probe, Adreno hardware and 16 KB runtime remain untested.

### Remaining validation and limits

The Android main-menu Video resolution popup now selects 3D render scale (100%, 75%, 67%)
instead of SDL desktop modes. Popup callbacks pass a row index, not the stored item value:
`menu_render_scale 0/1/2` maps to 100/75/67 and archives
`r_render_scale`; the existing OK/writeconfig path saves it. Changes apply on the next
3D view. Android startup forces `vid_native=1` and `vid_fullscreen=1` so previously saved
desktop mode selections cannot leave a smaller windowed SDL surface on the tablet.
Android OK writes config without `vid_apply`, avoiding an unnecessary surface resize.
The shared renderer draws large views into a reusable RGBA8 /
depth24 framebuffer and linearly blits the clipped viewport back to the native drawable.
Earlier background layers are copied into the target to preserve transparent menu scenes.
UI, touch coordinates and small portraits remain native. Targets are recreated after resize
and released at 100% and shutdown. Invalid scale values and multisampled drawables use native
rendering; Android currently requests zero MSAA. This does not reduce simulation or animation
work, and FPS improvement requires a same-scene device comparison.
Honor validation: the user selected the popup rows; the fixed build logged 75% as
1440x900 and a subsequent 67% selection as 1286x804, with UI at 1920x1200. Main-menu
text/buttons remained sharp and the 3D background rendered. Evidence is under
`build/android/honor/scale-75-final.log`, `scale-75-final.png` and `scale-config-final.cfg`.
The API35 emulator also created a 960x600 view at 75% of its 1280x800 drawable.
The engine `screenshot` command failed to write its relative `screenshots/` path on Android;
adb screencap was used for this visual check. Android screenshot storage remains a follow-up.

The Android runtime enables the `BZ_MUSIC_MP3` streaming backend for retail background
music. Earlier APKs had neither this backend nor FFmpeg and therefore played no music.
The backend uses the existing vendored minimp3 and stereo music mixer, with no retail
assets in the APK. FFmpeg movies and non-MP3 compressed music are not enabled.
On Honor, the updated APK logged `Music: streaming MP3 Sound\Music\mp3Music\Mainscreen.mp3`,
Android reported the game's OpenSL ES media player active, and the user confirmed audible
background music. Evidence: `build/android/honor/music-after.log` and `music-audio.txt`.

Broader campaign loading, audio output, save/load and touch gameplay still require verification.
The intermittent blank-button-label issue above remains open in both editions. APK structural checks, archive-import tests
and native startup tests cannot replace gameplay checks. The shader probe remains available separately.
Background/foreground recovery, context loss, import progress/cancellation across process death,
automatic removal of orphan `.import-*.tmp` files after process death, and additional GPU/page-size tests
remain follow-up work. Quit a game before replacing its archives.

## Engine work remaining

1. Reproduce/fix blank main-menu button labels with a focused regression, then exercise campaign loading, audio and saves.
2. Repeat the production shader APK checks on physical Adreno/Mali devices. `BZ_BONE_PALETTE_MAX` is 128;
   its default-block matrix uniforms can exceed GLES3 minimum limits. Compilation/linking on the emulator
   is not a substitute for physical GPU checks.
3. Finish import progress/cancellation and recovery from process death.
4. Add background/foreground timing and audio policy, and graphics resource restoration.
5. Verify [tablet context taps, pan/pinch and non-activating holds](games/warcraft-3/tablet-controls.md)
   on a physical tablet; SDL and game-command tests cover the input contract. Back and software-keyboard flow remain.
6. Check all native libraries and memory-mapping code on 4 KB and 16 KB page-size devices. In particular,
   investigate `FS_MmapFile`'s `MAP_FIXED` at `base + MMAP_HDR_SIZE` (16 bytes) with a regression test before fixing it.

Full Android gameplay, mobile lifecycle recovery and broader physical GPU validation remain pending.

### Direct map diagnostics and loading acknowledgement

The launcher also consumes an optional `map` string extra once. It forwards a restricted map path
to the ordinary `+map` command, allowing bounded on-device checks without navigating campaign menus:

```sh
adb -s DEVICE shell am start -n org.openrealm.wc3/.LauncherActivity \
  --ez play true --ei frames 20000 --es map Maps/Campaign/Undead05Interlude.w3m
```

Avoid `am start -W` for these checks: on Honor it could continue waiting after the SDL activity was
already visible. Poll `files/engine.log` with `run-as org.openrealm.wc3` instead. Once it logs
`Loading: ready, waiting for acknowledgement`, a fresh touch starts the map. Android enables the
client acknowledgement and server pre-begin simulation gate by default. See
[loading lifecycle and ARM64 interlude continuation](games/warcraft-3/loading-and-assets.md#touch-acknowledgement).
Temporary `com_fast_forward` or debug autoexec files used for diagnostics must be removed afterward.

The JASS type-retention regression extends `wc3_smoke.*` to four tests / six assertions.
`ImportTests` requires that full summary and a clean native exit. On Honor, a diagnostic build
with the old numerical pointer guard failed the enum-copy test (5/6); the fixed VM passes all six assertions and clean-exit checks
through the same instrumentation path (`build/android/honor/mission-ready-smoke-green.txt`).

## Frozen Throne credits test APK

Build the opt-in retail final-credits scene with the same optimized native modules:

```sh
JAVA_HOME='/Applications/PhpStorm.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home' make android-warcraft3-credits
```

Output: `build/android/game/openrealm-warcraft3-credits.apk`. The builder's `--credits`
option implies `--game` and generates a Java `LaunchConfig.CREDITS` constant. It does
not replace engine defaults or install an autoexec file. A normal `--game` build resets
that generated constant to false and still produces `openrealm-warcraft3.apk`.
Both variants use `org.openrealm.wc3` and the same output-directory signing key, so
installing one replaces the other while preserving imported archives and app data.

With base and expansion archives installed, opening the test APK automatically starts
`Maps/FrozenThrone/Campaign/War3XRegularCreditsIce.w3x` with `-tft`, 67% 3D scale,
`r_stats 1`, `r_vsync 0`, `com_maxfps 0`, `cl_loading_wait 0` and `sv_wait_for_begin 0`.
The original retail JASS controls credits, camera, units, weather and music.
This is the regular ice-scene ending, not the project's main-menu `menu_credits`
dialog or the separate `War3XBonusCredits.w3x` map. In the verified classic 1.26a data,
both credits maps are stored in `war3xlocal.mpq`, not `war3x.mpq`.

For a fresh diagnostic launch, force-stop the previous process first. The launcher
consumes `frames`, `map`, `scale`, `profile` and `particles` extras for that launch only. `scale` accepts
50–100 percent and defaults to 67 for missing/invalid values; `map` can select the
bonus credits or another diagnostic scene. Smoke instrumentation always bypasses
the credits profile and uses its fixture data. `profile=1` selects CPU/particle counters,
`profile=2` also attempts GPU timing; `particles=0/1` explicitly disables/enables the
retained particle pass for an isolation capture. Other values are ignored, and these
diagnostic overrides are never passed into smoke tests.

```sh
build/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s emulator-5554 install --no-incremental -r \
  build/android/game/openrealm-warcraft3-credits.apk
build/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s emulator-5554 shell am force-stop org.openrealm.wc3
build/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s emulator-5554 shell am start \
  -n org.openrealm.wc3/.LauncherActivity --ei frames 2000000 --ei scale 67
# While the scene is running, save stats and a native-surface screenshot:
build/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s emulator-5554 exec-out run-as org.openrealm.wc3 \
  cat files/engine.log > build/android/credits-runtime.log
build/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s emulator-5554 exec-out screencap -p \
  > build/android/credits-scene.png
```

`com_frame_limit` counts main-loop iterations, including those that do not render.
At uncapped startup, the 600- and 20,000-iteration checks exited cleanly immediately
after `G_ClientBegin`, before the first world snapshot/3D frame. The larger diagnostic
budget reaches the scene; terminate a capture explicitly after its intended time window
instead of treating that number as rendered frames or seconds. A normal icon launch
has no diagnostic frame limit.

Verification on October 16, 2026: the API35 ARM64 emulator automatically reached the
snowy bridge scene, displayed localized credits and animated units, and logged
`Render scale: 67%, 3D 857x536, UI 1280x800` followed by changing `[R_STATS]` lines.
Captures are `build/android/credits-scene.png`, `credits-scene-later.png` and
`credits-runtime.log`. The one-shot `--ei scale 50` launcher override also reached
the scene and logged 640x400 3D / 1280x800 UI (`credits-scale-50.log` and `.png`).
Both APK variants passed `ImportTests`, APK signatures/alignment passed, and the
final desktop `make test` completed successfully using the local SDL prefix.
Exclude loading statistics and compare matching simulation
intervals: the authored unit parade and random weather change the scene over time.
The emulator uses ANGLE/Vulkan SwiftShader; its FPS cannot predict Honor GPU performance.
`ImportTests` verifies variant startup, map/scale overrides, frame limits and smoke
isolation before the existing native startup/clean-exit checks. The desktop suite runs
with `make HOMEBREW_PREFIX="$PWD/build/android/sdl-host" test` in this local environment;
it needs ordinary local UDP access for networking tests.

The first effect-submission optimization and emulator profile interpretation are in
[WC3 performance](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#android-credits-profiling-october-2026).

## Honor performance investigation

The October 16, 2026 report is 50–60 FPS in menus and 15–30 FPS in maps at 67% scale.
`build/android/honor/mission-ready-final-runtime.log` identifies Mali-G52 MC2, GLES 3.2,
a 1920x1200 drawable, zero MSAA and `r_vsync 0`. Earlier scale logs confirm 1286x804 at
67%: about 45% of native pixel count, with native UI. This reduces fragment work, not
simulation, animation, geometry submission or vertex processing. The local CMake cache
and `realm_renderer.dir/flags.make` use RelWithDebInfo, `-O2 -g` and `-UNDEBUG`;
the Java manifest's `debuggable=true` does not mean unoptimized native code.

There is no weighted Honor CPU/GPU profile in these captures. The files
`build/android/honor/perf-current.log` and `perf-current.png` are empty, and the archived
Honor runtime logs contain no `[R_STATS]` lines. Do not infer a dominant subsystem from
menu/game FPS alone or reuse desktop/Linux sample percentages as Android timings.

### Source-confirmed candidates, not measured FPS gains

| Path | Current work | What a device comparison should decide |
|---|---|---|
| `renderer/r_main.c:R_BeginScaledView` / `R_EndScaledView` | Every eligible scaled view copies native color into the smaller FBO, renders, then blits back. The first copy covers the entire drawable even if the viewport is smaller. No transient-depth invalidation is issued. | Measure the copies and render-target transitions separately. Preserve prior layers for transparent menu scenes; omit the incoming copy only for views whose background is explicitly independent. |
| `w3m/r_war3map.c:_W3M_DrawWorld` | Each `g_groundLayers` buffer submits ground for the whole map; cliffs and water use frustum-culled segments through `R_DrawTerrainSegment`. | Compare submitted vertices and GPU time with visible segment ranges. Keep material ordering and deformation updates; avoid trading all vertex savings for excessive tiny draws. |
| `mdx/r_mdx_geoset.c:MDX_RenderModel` | Solid and alpha passes each call `MDLX_BindBoneMatrices`; attachments and event transforms can evaluate the pose again. | Count pose evaluations per entity/view and profile animation before adding reuse. Keys/lifetimes must include interpolation, global-sequence time and view-dependent billboard transforms. |
| `r_game.c:R_ConformGroundSurfaces` | Each eligible conformer scans the complete view entity list for support surfaces, even when none exist. | Profile this path; the focused collection-pass proposal and required behavior tests are in [WC3 performance](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#september-21-cpu-profile-graveyard-update-scan). |

Paths abbreviated as `w3m/`, `mdx/` and `r_game.c` above belong to
`games/warcraft-3/renderer/`. Whole-map ground batching is deliberate:
`d1647cbd` retains one draw per layer while updating deformed segment slices in place.
It is a draw-count versus submitted-geometry tradeoff, not evidence of an accidental regression.
For render-target handling, [Arm's framebuffer guidance](https://developer.arm.com/community/arm-community-blogs/b/mobile-graphics-and-gaming-blog/posts/mali-performance-2-how-to-correctly-handle-framebuffers)
explains why avoiding unnecessary loads/stores and invalidating transient attachments before
leaving a render pass matters. Actual savings still require a same-device measurement.

### Controls that currently do less than their labels suggest

`r_model_detail`, `r_anim_quality`, `r_texture_quality` and `r_lights` are registered and
editable in the options UI, but have no renderer consumers in this checkout. Lowering them
does not implement LOD, cheaper animation, a texture mip limit or fewer lights.
`r_particles` is only a boolean check in `R_DrawParticles`: 1 and 2 take the same path;
0 skips particle update/draw there but does not stop emitter work elsewhere.
`r_entities 0` skips `R_DrawEntities`, including solid models and blob shadows, but the
WC3 alpha-model loop in `R_DrawAlphaSurfaces` still runs. Treat it as a partial diagnostic.
`r_fogofwar 0` does not stop server fog simulation or the initial client data update.

### Next on-device capture

Use the same map/save, camera and simulation interval for each comparison. Record scale,
temperature/elapsed run time, `[R_STATS]` draws/vertices/triangles and frame time; repeat
runs so changing campaign content or thermal drift cannot masquerade as an optimization.
Request `com_maxfps 0`, `r_vsync 0` and `r_stats 1` for measurement. Compare
`set r_render_scale 100`, `67` and `50` separately (50 is accepted by the renderer but
is not a popup choice). Restore each setting before testing the next variable.
`r_unit_shadows 0` and `r_particles 0` can isolate parts of the rendering work briefly.
`r_norefresh 1` with `r_stats 1` prints `[R_NOREFRESH] loops=...` while simulation/client
processing continues; this is a main-loop throughput diagnostic, not rendered FPS.

The existing NDK includes Simpleperf. With the game already running in the chosen scene,
this suggested 10-second capture uses the debuggable package without requesting root:

```sh
export ANDROID_SERIAL=DEVICE_SERIAL
export PATH="$PWD/build/android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH"
perf_root="$PWD"
perf_ndk="$perf_root/build/android/sdk/ndk/28.2.13676358"
mkdir -p build/android/honor/profile
cd build/android/honor/profile
python3 "$perf_ndk/simpleperf/app_profiler.py" -p org.openrealm.wc3 \
  --disable_adb_root --ndk_path "$perf_ndk" \
  -lib "$perf_root/build/android/probe/native" \
  -r '-e task-clock:u -f 1000 -g --duration 10' -o perf.data
python3 "$perf_ndk/simpleperf/report_html.py" -i perf.data -o report.html --no_browser
```

The direct rootless record/report path was verified on Honor (Android 12) on October 16, 2026:

```sh
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL push "$perf_ndk/simpleperf/bin/android/arm64/simpleperf" /data/local/tmp/simpleperf
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL shell /data/local/tmp/simpleperf record --app org.openrealm.wc3 \
  -e task-clock:u -f 1000 -g --duration 15 -o /data/local/tmp/credits-cpu.data
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL pull /data/local/tmp/credits-cpu.data perf.data
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL shell /data/local/tmp/simpleperf report -i /data/local/tmp/credits-cpu.data \
  --children --sort comm,dso,symbol > report.txt
```

No root or system perf-setting changes were needed; the first steady capture recorded
15,147 samples with no loss. Keep the matching unstripped native libraries/APK for
call-site resolution. The `app_profiler.py` helper above additionally copies symbols;
its full workflow was exercised on the emulator, while the direct commands were used on Honor.
Inspect the native `org.openrealm.wc3:game` process separately from the Java launcher and audio
threads. CPU samples alone cannot measure GPU execution or time blocked in presentation.
The [whole game-loop Honor profile](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#whole-game-loop-cpu-and-scheduler-profile-october-17)
combines matching `-O2 -g` symbols, all-thread sampling and a separate
switch/wakeup/EGL trace. It records the distinction between CPU execution,
runnable delay, blocked time and inclusive function percentages.
The [parallel pose probe](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#parallel-pose-feasibility-on-honor-october-17)
compares isolated CPU work across lanes and CPU placements; its throughput
numbers are not game FPS or an application thread-affinity policy.
The [Android MDX worker implementation](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#parallel-mdx-preparation-on-android-october-18)
documents current defaults, cache ownership, submission order and the separate
first-fight comparisons used for game acceptance.
The [effect geometry modes](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#effect-geometry-modes-and-retained-experiments-october-18)
document `r_mdx_effect_instancing`: 0 retains original eligibility, 1 expands
eligibility with normal palette selection, and Android's default 2 combines
expanded eligibility with uniform packets. The no-gain mode remains available
under the [experiment retention rule](performance-experiments.md).
The Honor extension log advertises `GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query`, but extension presence
does not establish valid timings. The current optional asynchronous profiler rejects
disjoint and implausible results; this Honor driver has returned invalid durations.
See [CPU/GPU diagnostics](renderer-backend.md#cpugpu-frame-diagnostics) for the contract.

The bounded capture helper preserves imported archives, performs a fresh launch, warms
up from `G_ClientBegin`, records the requested window and force-stops afterward:

```sh
python3 tools/android/measure_credits.py --serial DEVICE_SERIAL \
  --apk build/android/game/openrealm-warcraft3-credits.apk \
  --scale 67 --profile 1 --warmup 40 --duration 15 --out build/android/captures/run67
```

Use fresh output directories. Compare `--scale 100/67/50`, `--particles 0` and
`--profile 0/1/2` one variable at a time. Logs, screenshot, battery state, APK hash
when installed, individual windows, medians and sample-weighted valid GPU means are
saved under `--out`. The helper passes a large finite frame limit because the engine
counts main-loop iterations rather than rendered frames, and explicitly stops after
capture. It does not leave the game running; launch the normal 67% credits afterward.

Before a capture that changes user files, back up both their bytes and whether
each optional file exists. Check presence with `adb shell run-as org.openrealm.wc3
test -f PATH` before reading: on this Honor, `adb exec-out ... cat` returned zero
while its output was `cat: ...: No such file or directory`. That error text is
not a configuration backup. Restore absence with `rm -f`, verify config/map/
campaign/save hashes and keep test overrides out of later ordinary launches.
A live game's diagnostic log may change after restoration; check user data
without restarting a game opened during final verification.

### System frame-pacing capture

On the Honor Android 12 device, `atrace` provides `gfx`, `sched`, `freq`,
`idle` and `sync` categories without root. Capture after the unprofiled FPS
window, with the scene still running:

```sh
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL shell atrace --list_categories
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL shell atrace -b 16384 -t 10 \
  -a org.openrealm.wc3,org.openrealm.wc3:game \
  -o /data/local/tmp/openrealm-frames.trace gfx sched freq idle sync
adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL pull /data/local/tmp/openrealm-frames.trace frames.trace
```

Read `sched_switch` slices for the actual native `SDLThread` TID, not the
launcher process. `tracing_mark_write` B/E markers expose EGL swaps and nested
buffer-queue calls; their durations are wall time, not GPU timers. Counter
events and nested spans must not be summed as independent work. The bounded
command stops tracing on exit; verify `debug.atrace.tags.enableflags` is 0
afterward. Keep trace-enabled captures separate from primary FPS measurements.

`dumpsys SurfaceFlinger --timestats -dump` contains cumulative data from older
runs under the same layer name. Preserve snapshots and use deltas rather than
its raw `averageFPS`; do not clear prior diagnostics. `--timestats -enable` /
`-disable` control collection. The `run-as ... taskset -p ...` scheduler call
returns permission errors on this Honor, and MTK GPU frequency/utilization
files under `/sys/kernel/ged/hal/` and `/proc/gpufreq/` are also unreadable.
The trace's CPU-frequency events and scheduler slices remain usable. See the
[200-actor measurements](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#honor-200-actor-performance).

On this Honor, the native process working directory is `/`; the renderer's
relative `screenshots/shotNNNN.jpg` write fails there. Physical framebuffer QA
therefore used `adb exec-out screencap -p` after the measured window. Do not
include screenshot/readback time in the FPS measurement.

## Optimization build policy and exact fog cache

During optimization, build only the test/profile artifacts needed by the current
experiment. Ordinary/distribution builds require an explicit user request; do
not add them as a routine finishing step. Reuse a suitable existing APK for
comparisons. This user preference is also recorded in `AGENTS.md`.

The October 18 exact sight-cache trial exposes `wc3_fow_cache` (Android default
`1`, other platforms `0`) and `wc3_fow_stats`. The independent final test-APK
B/D/D/B capture gives 17.985 → 18.911 FPS at 67% render on the mixed 200-starting-unit
first combat. Its code, tests and on/off paths are retained. See
[measured results](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#exact-sight-footprint-reuse-on-honor-october-18)
and the [fog cache contract](games/warcraft-3/fog-and-cinematics.md#exact-sight-footprint-cache).

The subsequent MDX submission experiment is opt-in: `set r_mdx_submit_cache 0`
keeps the original shared stream, `1` selects per-model matrix streams, and `2`
also selects persistent instance VAOs. It defaults to 0 on all platforms. Six
Honor windows show only a small improvement (18.371 -> 18.828 FPS for mode 1;
18.731 for mode 2); a separate profile still attributes about 25.6% of main
userspace CPU to the Mali driver. The preceding working APK is restored after
these tests. See [submission and concurrency findings](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#mdx-submission-bindings-and-concurrency-audit-october-18).

The independent CPU packet trial uses `r_mdx_packet_prepare 0/1/2`: original
on-demand work, owner-prepared packets, or preparation inside existing pose jobs.
It initially defaults to 0. `MDX_POSE` reports `packets`, `worker_packets`,
`packet_hits` and `packet_misses`; mode 2 must show worker packets before claiming
parallel use. GL submission and emitter/RNG updates remain on the owner. Six
same-APK Honor windows give 18.653 FPS original, 19.115 owner-prepared and
18.967 parallel: parallel preparation has no demonstrated FPS advantage over
the owner control. The comparison used default 0 and restored the preceding
APK/settings. At the owner's subsequent request, the Android build now defaults
to **2** while other platforms remain at 0. `set r_mdx_packet_prepare 0` disables
the new preparation; mode 1 remains available. The ordinary Android launcher
keeps its normal startup flow, without a forced test map or credits scene.
See [packet preparation](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#parallel-draw-packet-preparation-october-18)
for the bounded arena, test coverage and measurements.

The larger-packet trial adds `r_mdx_palette_ubo 0/1/2`: existing
transport, UBO with the original 128-matrix packet cap, or UBO with a queried
larger cap (1,024 on Honor). It preserves exact animation/depth math and uses
Android's current CPU packet mode 2. `MDX_BATCH block_packets/bone_limit` prove
activation. A standalone EGL readback of the production shader/upload passes
on Mali at palette indices 64, 129 and 194. See the [larger-packet trial](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#larger-uniform-block-palette-packets-october-18)
for the measured comparison, limitations and restoration record.

The six-window same-APK comparison gives 18.585 FPS original, 18.865 with a
128-matrix UBO control and 19.336 with 1,024 matrices (+4.04% from original).
Median draw calls drop about 13.65%. The trial initially defaulted to 0; the
owner's subsequent instruction to enable beneficial optimizations changes the
Android source default to **2**, with other platforms staying at **0**.
`set r_mdx_palette_ubo 0` retains the original transport. This modest gain does
not meet 40 FPS. The preceding requested working APK and original
Honor settings, campaign progress and save hashes were restored after testing.
No additional APK build/install accompanied that source-default activation while
the device was in active gameplay; the next requested/test-required Android
package would include it. See the activation record (`$OPENREALM_EXPERIMENTS_DIR/warcraft-3/optimization-archive/mdx-wide-batches-enabled-20261018/README.md`, external archive).

The subsequent owner-authorized October 18 profile reuses the existing measured
`aa0c9bfb…` APK with an explicit `r_mdx_palette_ubo 2`; no APK rebuild is needed.
Its separate unprofiled first combat gives 20.397 FPS at 67% render. Two
20-second, 500-Hz userspace CPU profiles agree on roughly 35% server / 65% client
and 23–24% Mali driver leaf CPU on the main thread. A separate complete scheduler
trace shows 78.25% running and about 8.99 ms/swap blocked inside EGL, which is
not a GPU timer. See the [profile and concrete next targets](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#honor-profile-after-larger-packets-october-18)
and raw evidence/recipes (`$OPENREALM_EXPERIMENTS_DIR/warcraft-3/optimization-archive/post-wide-profile-20261018/README.md`, external archive).
The tested APK now remains installed with mode 2 saved in the original config;
all other backed-up settings, campaign progress and save/checkpoint hashes are
restored. The ordinary launcher is open without a forced benchmark process.

The next CPU-work trial adds independent `wc3_ability_cache`,
`wc3_visibility_fast` and `r_splat_cache` switches. The first two now default
to 1 on Android after correctness checks, a bounded production-query benchmark
and a same-APK 19.272 → 20.302 FPS (+5.34%) paired combat comparison at 67% render.
Other platforms retain 0. The splat cache remains 0 everywhere: its separate
comparison regresses about 2.30%, and the full variant is preserved.
This does not reach 40 FPS or establish a first-mission/100%-render gain.

Only game and renderer libraries are replaced in the reused Java/assets test
APK `338c5e3d…`; there is no ordinary packaging pass. The measured APK compiled
the new defaults as 0, and explicit settings select each comparison. It remains
installed with ability/visibility saved as 1 in the original config, existing
palette mode 2 retained, and the test-only startup map/bindings/profiling removed.
All current save/checkpoint hashes and the other backed-up files are verified.

The subsequent post-merge profile uses revision `64be2dac` and the already
installed matching `db6ff813…` APK. The owner's current measurement policy is
**100% native resolution**: logs verify `r_render_scale 100`, a 1920x1200
drawable and no scaled framebuffer. Two separate FPS windows yield 18.224 /
18.637 FPS, combined **18.431 FPS**. Two independent CPU recordings have zero
sample loss; a separate scheduler trace is complete. These measurements are a
new baseline, not an A/B result against an older revision at 67%. Original
settings, campaign/map/log bytes and all save/checkpoint hashes are restored;
no packaging or install is needed. See the [fresh profile and CPU targets](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#fresh-post-merge-honor-profile-at-native-resolution-october-18)
and raw evidence/recipes (`$OPENREALM_EXPERIMENTS_DIR/warcraft-3/optimization-archive/native-profile-20261018/README.md`, external archive).
See [contracts, all windows and CPU evidence](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#ability-visibility-and-splat-cpu-work-october-18)
and the complete retained trial (`$OPENREALM_EXPERIMENTS_DIR/warcraft-3/optimization-archive/cpu-work-families-20261018/README.md`, external archive).

## Selectable ANGLE Vulkan experiment

The game test APK includes app-local ANGLE with a Video settings **Graphics API**
choice: **OpenGL ES** / **Vulkan (ANGLE)**. OK saves `r_backend gl` or
`r_backend vulkan`; restart the application to apply it. Source default remains
GLES. The control appears only when the packaged libraries load and the device
has hardware Vulkan. No Android global driver setting or Mali driver is changed.

Prepare the exact pinned SDK35 libraries once with the
[read-only import recipe](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/blob/main/packaging/android/angle/README.md#prepare-once).
The normal game test-APK command then verifies their hashes and packages the
manifest/license/notices. `--without-angle` builds GLES only; `--angle-dir`
imports already extracted matching files. There is no automatic substitution
of another ANGLE build when this cache is absent/corrupt. Tests cover import,
cache reuse, corrupt/wrong-ABI rejection, and preserving an existing cache when
the second source library is invalid.

For a bounded diagnostic launch, the Android intent accepts only `gl`/`vulkan`:

```sh
adb -s AE5HCP3B27401902 shell am start -S -W \
  -n org.openrealm.wc3/.LauncherActivity --ez play true --ez tft true \
  --ei frames 1800 --es backend vulkan
```

Ordinary launch supplies no backend override and uses the saved setting.
`--es backend gl` can recover a run from an unsuitable Vulkan selection; save
OpenGL ES in Video settings before restarting normally. Headless smoke ignores
graphics overrides. `--ei profile 2` requests GPU queries and overrides an
`r_profile` value from autoexec, so confirm actual `[R_GPU]` rows before reporting
GPU timing. Instrumentation on this Honor prints the custom PASS stream without
a literal `result=PASS`; verify the explicit import/startup/clean-exit assertions.

The first AOSP ANGLE trial had huge particle triangles, disappearing terrain,
internal Vulkan errors and roughly 2 FPS in combat. Switching only its app-local
ANGLE libraries to the pinned SDK35 binaries removes the reproduced GL error
and restores performance near GLES. This does not establish a major speedup or
40 FPS. See [measurements and limitations](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#angle-vulkan-bridge-on-honor-october-18)
and the complete retained trial (`$OPENREALM_EXPERIMENTS_DIR/warcraft-3/optimization-archive/vulkan-backend-20261018/README.md`, external archive).

The subsequent [Durotar opening profile](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#durotar-opening-mission-profile-at-native-resolution-october-18)
reproduces 10–11 FPS at 100% native resolution on both GLES and Vulkan. Four
CPU recordings identify map-wide simulation, visibility/tint and selection
scans; GPU and scheduler windows are recorded separately. See the
raw profiles and recipes (`$OPENREALM_EXPERIMENTS_DIR/warcraft-3/optimization-archive/durotar-profile-20261018/README.md`, external archive).

The subsequent [server scan changes](games/warcraft-3/performance.md#lan-safe-server-scan-package-on-durotar-october-18)
retain LAN-recipient semantics and improve the same 100%-native OrcX01
intro/gameplay by 20.99% / 16.09% in a same-APK A/B/B/A comparison. Android
defaults enable `wc3_selection_mask`, `wc3_tint_fast` and
`wc3_aura_candidates`; setting any option to 0 retains its reference path.
The complete trial (`$OPENREALM_EXPERIMENTS_DIR/warcraft-3/optimization-archive/server-work-20261018/README.md`, external archive)
separates prototype comparisons from final default activation and preserves
all sources, tests, raw windows and user-file restoration proof.
